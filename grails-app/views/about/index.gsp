				<h2>Getting to know Indianapolis</h2>
				<p>Indianapolis is the capital and most populous city of the U.S. state of
				Indiana, and also the county seat of Marion County. As of the 2010 census, the
				city's population is 820,445. It is the 12th largest city in the United States
				and the 29th largest metropolitan area in the United States.</p>
				<p>Historically, Indianapolis has oriented itself around government (a byproduct
				of its state capital function) and industry, particularly manufacturing. Over
				the late decades of the 20th century, the city's Unigov began a long process to
				revitalize the downtown area. Today, Indianapolis has a much more diversified
				economy, contributing to the fields of education, health care, and finance.
				Tourism is also a vital part of the economy of Indianapolis, with the city
				playing host to numerous conventions and sporting events. Of these, perhaps the
				most well known are the annual Indianapolis 500, Brickyard 400, and NHRA U.S.
				Nationals. Other major sporting events include the annual Big Ten Conference
				football championship and the Men's and Women's NCAA basketball tournaments.
				Indianapolis also hosted the Super Bowl XLVI in 2012.</p>
				<p>Both Forbes and Livability.com rank Indianapolis as one of the best downtowns
				in the United States citing "more than 200 retail shops, more than 35 hotels,
				nearly 300 restaurants and food options, movie theaters, sports venues,
				museums, art galleries and parks" as attractions. Greater Indianapolis has seen
				moderate growth among U.S. cities. The population of the metropolitan
				statistical area was 1,756,241 according to the 2010 Census, making it the
				34th-largest in the United States. The 2010 population of the Indianapolis
				combined statistical area, a larger trade area, was 2,080,782, the 23rd-largest
				in the country. Indianapolis is considered a gamma global city by the
				Globalization and World Cities Research Network. In 2013, the city won Sister
				Cities International's 2013 Best Overall Program award for jurisdictions of
				population 500,000 and above.</p>
				<div id="history"></div>
				<h2>History</h2>
				<p>Native Americans who lived in the area originally included the Miami and Lenape
				(or Delaware) tribes, but they were displaced from the area by the early
				1820s.</p>
				<p>Indianapolis was selected as the site of the new state capital in 1820, the old
				state capital having been Corydon since the formation of the state of Indiana
				in 1816. While most American state capitals tend to be located in the central
				region of their respective states, Indianapolis is the closest capital to being
				placed in the exact center of its state. It was founded on the White River
				both because of this, and because of the incorrect assumption that the river
				would serve as a major transportation artery. However, the waterway eventually
				proved to be too sandy for trade. Jeremiah Sullivan, a judge of the Indiana
				Supreme Court, invented the name Indianapolis by joining Indiana with polis,
				the Greek word for city; Indianapolis literally means "Indiana City". The state
				commissioned Alexander Ralston to design the new capital city. Ralston was an
				apprentice to the French architect Pierre L'Enfant, and he helped L'Enfant plan
				Washington, D.C. Ralston's original plan for Indianapolis called for a city of
				only one square mile (3 km²). At the center of the city sat Governor's Circle,
				a large circular commons, which was to be the site of the governor's mansion.
				Meridian and Market Streets converge at the Circle and continue north–south and
				east–west, respectively. The Capital moved from Corydon on January 10, 1825.
				The governor's mansion was eventually demolished in 1857 and in its place
				stands a 284-foot (87 m) tall neoclassical limestone and bronze monument, the
				Indiana Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument. The surrounding street is now known as
				Monument Circle or just "The Circle".</p>
				<p>The city lies on the original east–west National Road. The first railroad to
				serve Indianapolis, the Madison and Indianapolis, began operation on October 1,
				1847, and subsequent railroad connections made expansive growth possible.
				Indianapolis was the home of the first Union Station, or common rail passenger
				terminal, in the United States. By the turn of the 20th century, Indianapolis
				had become a large automobile manufacturer, rivaling the likes of Detroit. With
				roads leading out of the city in all directions, Indianapolis became a major
				hub of regional transport connecting to Chicago, Louisville, Cincinnati,
				Columbus, Detroit, Cleveland, and St. Louis, befitting the capital of a state
				whose nickname is "The Crossroads of America". This same network of roads would
				allow quick and easy access to suburban areas in future years.</p>
				<p>City population grew rapidly throughout the first half of the 20th century.
				While rapid suburbanization began to take place in the second half of the
				century, race relations deteriorated.[citation needed] Even so, on the night
				that Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated, Indianapolis was one of the few
				major cities in which rioting did not occur. Many credit the speech by
				Robert F. Kennedy, who was in town campaigning for President that night, for
				helping to calm the tensions. Racial tensions heightened in 1970 with the
				passage of Unigov, which further isolated the middle class from Indianapolis's
				growing African American community.[citation needed] Although Indianapolis and
				the state of Indiana abolished segregated schools just prior to Brown vs. Board
				of Education, the later action of court-ordered school desegregation busing by
				Judge S. Hugh Dillin was a controversial change.</p>
				<p>In 1970, non-Hispanic whites were about 80 percent of the population. The
				1970s and 1980s ushered in a period of planning and revitalization for the
				urban core of Indianapolis. Changes came early with the reorientation of the
				city’s government. Unigov was created as the result of a 1970 consolidation
				between city and county government. The city of Indianapolis merged most
				government services with those of Marion County. For the most part, this
				resulted in a unification of Indianapolis with its immediate suburbs. This
				caused the boundaries of the city to grow tremendously, reflected in
				Indianapolis’ jump in ranking to the nation's 11th largest city in 1970. The
				City-County Building housed the newly consolidated government. At its
				completion, the City-County Building became the city’s tallest building and the
				first building in the city to be taller than the Soldiers' and Sailors'
				Monument. Amidst the changes in government and growth, the city’s role as a
				major transportation hub and tourist destination was further strengthened with
				the Weir Cook Municipal Airport receiving its international designation in
				1975.</p>
				<p>In the 1970s and 1980s, Indianapolis suffered at the hands of urban decay and
				white flight. Major revitalization of the city's blighted areas, such as Fall
				Creek Place and Downtown Indianapolis, began in the 1980s and led to an
				acceleration of growth on the fringes of the metropolitan area. The openings of
				the RCA Dome, Circle Centre, and the Indianapolis Artsgarden revitalized the
				central business district. The city hosted the 1987 Pan American Games. The
				city and state have invested heavily in improvement projects such as an
				expansion to the Indiana Convention Center, upgrade of the I-465 beltway, and
				construction of an entirely new airport terminal for the Indianapolis
				International Airport. Construction of the Indianapolis Colts' new home,
				Lucas Oil Stadium, was completed in August 2008, and the hotel and convention
				center expansion were completed in early 2011.</p>
				<div id="weather"></div>
				<h2>Weather</h2>
				<p>As is typical in much of the Midwest, Indianapolis has a humid continental
				climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa) with four distinct seasons. Summers
				are hot and humid, with a July daily average temperature of 75.4 °F (24.1 °C).
				High temperatures reach or exceed 90 °F (32 °C) an average of 18 days each
				year, and occasionally exceed 95 °F (35 °C). Spring and autumn are usually
				pleasant, if at times unpredictable; midday temperature drops exceeding 30 °F
				or 17 °C are common during March and April, and instances of very warm days (80
				°F or 27 °C) followed within 36 hours by snowfall are not unusual during these
				months. Winters are cold, with an average January temperature of 28.1 °F (−2.2
				°C). Temperatures dip to 0 °F (−18 °C) or below an average of 4.7 nights per
				year. The rainiest months occur in the spring and summer, with slightly
				higher averages during May, June, and July. May is typically the wettest, with
				an average of 5.05 inches (12.8 cm) of precipitation. Most rain is derived
				from thunderstorm activity; there is no distinct dry season. The city's average
				annual precipitation is 42.4 inches (108 cm), with snowfall averaging 25.9
				inches (66 cm) per season. Official temperature extremes range from 106 °F (41
				°C), set on July 14, 1936, to −27 °F (−33 °C), set on January 19,
				1994.</p>
				<div id="culture"></div>
				<h2>Culture</h2>
				<p>Indianapolis prides itself on its rich cultural heritage. Several initiatives
				have been made by the Indianapolis government in recent years to increase
				Indianapolis's appeal as a destination for arts and culture.</p>
				<h3>Cultural Districts</h3>
				<p>Indianapolis has designated six official Cultural Districts. They are Broad
				Ripple Village, Massachusetts Avenue, Fountain Square, The Wholesale District,
				Canal and White River State Park, and Indiana Avenue. These areas have held
				historic and cultural importance to the city. In recent years they have been
				revitalized and are becoming major centers for tourism, commerce and
				residential living.</p>
				<h3>Cultural Trail</h3>
				<p>Constructed between 2007 and 2013, the Indianapolis Cultural Trail is an urban
				bike and pedestrian path that connects the city's five downtown Cultural
				Districts, neighborhoods and entertainment amenities, and serves as the
				downtown hub for the entire central Indiana greenway system. The trail includes
				benches, bike racks, lighting, signage and bike rentals/drop-offs along the way
				and also features local art work. It was officially opened in May 2013.</p>
				<h3>Monument Circle</h3>
				<p>At the center of Indianapolis is Monument Circle, a traffic circle at the
				intersection of Meridian and Market Streets, featuring the Soldiers' and
				Sailors' Monument. Monument Circle is depicted on the city’s flag. It is in the
				shadow of Indiana's tallest skyscraper, the Chase Tower. Until the early 1960s,
				Indianapolis zoning laws stated that no building could be taller than the
				Soldiers and Sailors Monument. Each Christmas season, lights are strung onto
				the monument and lit in a ceremony known as the Circle of Lights, which
				attracts tens of thousands of Hoosiers to downtown Indianapolis on the day
				after Thanksgiving.</p>
				<h3>War Memorial Plaza</h3>
				<p>A five-block plaza at the intersection of Meridian and Vermont surrounds a
				large memorial dedicated to Hoosiers who have fought in American wars. It was
				originally constructed to honor the Indiana soldiers who died in World War I,
				but construction was halted due to lack of funding during the Great Depression,
				and it was finished in 1951. The purpose of the memorial was later altered to
				encompass all American wars in which Hoosiers fought.</p>
				<p>The monument is modeled after the Mausoleum of Maussollos. At 210 feet (64 m)
				tall, it is approximately 75 feet taller than the original Mausoleum. On the
				north end of the War Memorial Plaza is the national headquarters of the
				American Legion and the Indianapolis Public Library's Central Library.</p>
				<h3>Indiana Statehouse</h3>
				<p>The Statehouse houses the Indiana General Assembly, the Governor of Indiana,
				state courts, and other state officials.</p>
				<h3>Monuments</h3>

It has subsequently become a regional theatre and a member of the League of Resident Theatres.  The theatre is well known in the state for their production of Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol as adapted by Tom Haas, a late IRT artistic director/member of the former repertory company. It is a chamber theatre production modeled on David Edgar's The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby, that retains many of the story's darkest elements, such as the scene featuring Want and Ignorance that Dickens himself considered its heart, but is often omitted.  Come to Indy and see how the story was meant to be told!","heading":"Indiana Repertory Theatre","image":"theatre-irt.png","name":"Indiana Repertory Theatre","type":{"class":"goindyjava.ActivityType","id":39}},{"class":"goindyjava.Activity","id":74,"description":"Phoenix Theatre is a year-round, 30-year-old professional company presenting live contemporary theatre in an intimate setting.
